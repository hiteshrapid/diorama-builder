# Diorama — Project Knowledge

Configurable 3D workspace visualizer for OpenClaw. Users build spatial layouts for AI agents with rooms, furniture, and themes via a wizard, then watch agents in real time.

## Monorepo Structure

npm workspaces — 5 packages under `packages/`:

| Package | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `@diorama/engine` | `packages/engine` | Core: config (Zod), plugin registry, event bus, geometry/coordinates, agent state, activity state, room graph/pathfinding, room presets (5 presets × 4 themes), auto-layout, furniture catalog (20 items), floor textures (5 styles) |
| `@diorama/plugins` | `packages/plugins` | Source plugins (OpenClaw gateway w/ Ed25519, mock data), theme plugins (neon-dark, warm-office, cyberpunk, minimal) |
| `@diorama/ui` | `packages/ui` | Builder store (reducer, 12 action types, undo/redo), config sync, room catalog |
| `@diorama/cli` | `packages/cli` | Scaffolding (`diorama init`), templates (starter, full-office, minimal) |
| `@diorama/app` | `packages/app` | Next.js 15 app: 4-step wizard, R3F 3D scene, builder sidebar, spatial editor |

## Architecture

### Coordinate System
- Canvas: 1800×1000, GRID_UNIT = 200 canvas units
- World: scale 0.018 → 1 grid cell = 3.6 world units (GRID_WORLD)
- Room positions/sizes are in grid units, converted for rendering

### Wizard Flow
1. **Connect** — Gateway URL + token, or demo mode
2. **Build Your Office** — Spatial editor (3D view) with sidebar (rooms, agents, theme, furniture tabs)
3. **Configure Agents** — Seat assignment, allowed rooms, energy level per agent
4. **Launch** — Save config to `~/.diorama/config.json`

### Scene (R3F)
- `BuildStep.tsx` — Main component: manages state (useReducer), sidebar, toolbar (Select + undo/redo)
- `BuildStep3D.tsx` — Canvas with PerspectiveCamera (3D only), OrbitControls
  - `CameraSync` component: imperatively centers camera + OrbitControls target on `roomsCenter` (world-space centroid of all rooms via `toWorld()`)
  - Directional + ambient lighting (`meshStandardMaterial`), glass walls, neon edge glow
- `Room3D.tsx` — Renders floor mesh, walls, labels, furniture, selection highlight
  - Full 3D furniture via `RoomFurniture3D`, dimension callouts on all 4 edges when selected
  - Floor texture rendering: procedural canvas textures (512x512) via `drawFloorPattern()`, applied as `meshStandardMaterial` map + emissive self-illumination (`emissiveIntensity: 0.3`) to ensure patterns visible in dark themes
  - Three-tier floor style resolution: per-room override > preset+theme default > "solid" fallback
- `ProToolbar.tsx` — Select indicator + undo/redo buttons
- Hooks: `useDragRoom` (drag-to-move with grid snap), `useResizeRoom` (8-handle resize), `useFurniturePlacement` (click-to-place)
- All hooks use ref-based patterns for R3F event handlers (avoid stale closures)
- Sidebar scroll: `minHeight: 0` + `overflow: hidden` on flex containers in the height chain (wizard page → BuildStep → sidebar)

### Builder Store (`@diorama/ui`)
- `builderReducer` with actions: ADD_ROOM, REMOVE_ROOM, MOVE_ROOM, RESIZE_ROOM, SELECT_ROOM, SET_ROOM_COLORS, SET_FLOOR_STYLE, ADD_FURNITURE, REMOVE_FURNITURE, UNDO, REDO
- Full undo/redo via past/future history stacks

### Room Presets
5 types: meeting, workspace, private, social, lab — each with theme-dependent furniture and floor/wall colors.

### Themes
4 built-in: neon-dark (sci-fi), warm-office (modern), cyberpunk, minimal. Each exports `colors` (background, accent) and furniture material definitions.

## Conventions

- All app components use `"use client"` directive
- Inline styles throughout (no Tailwind, no CSS modules)
- Dark theme: `#0d1520` backgrounds, `#1a2535` borders, `#8090c0` accents
- Engine exports pure functions; React/Three.js code lives only in `packages/app`
- Monospace font: `'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace`

## Changelog

### 2026-04-08 — Floor Style Fix (4 bugs)

Fixed floor texture system that broke after 2D view removal:

1. **Floor textures invisible in 3D** — Dark theme colors made patterns unreadable under `meshStandardMaterial` lighting. Added emissive self-illumination (`emissive="#ffffff"`, `emissiveMap`, `emissiveIntensity=0.3`) to textured floor material in `Room3D.tsx`.
2. **Custom room preset default mismatch** — Custom rooms fell back to workspace preset (carpet) instead of solid. Removed stale workspace fallback in `Room3D.tsx`.
3. **Floor style/colors/furniture lost on config save** — `BuilderSidebar.tsx` `configToRooms()` and save effect only copied core fields. Added conditional spread for `colors`, `floorStyle`, `furniture`.
4. **`drawFloorPattern` missing default case** — Invalid floor style silently rendered transparent. Added solid-color default case in `floorTexture.ts`.

Tests added: 15 new tests across `floorTexture.test.ts`, `roomPresets.test.ts`, `builderStore.test.ts`, `config.test.ts`. Total: 372+.

### 2026-04-08 — Click-to-Deselect Rooms

Clicking empty space in the 3D scene now deselects the selected room. Previously `onPointerMissed` on the Canvas never fired because the `DragGroundPlane` mesh intercepted all empty-space clicks.

- Added `onPointerDown` prop to `DragGroundPlane.tsx` that dispatches `SELECT_ROOM` with `null`
- Optimized `builderReducer` SELECT_ROOM to short-circuit when selection unchanged (same state ref)
- 3 new tests in `builderStore.test.ts`. Total: 378+.

### 2026-04-09 — Agent Behavior System

Added pathfinding, energy system, and agent behavior wizard step:

- **Room graph & pathfinding** (`roomGraph.ts`) — Builds connectivity graph from room positions/doors, BFS shortest path, world-space waypoint generation for smooth agent movement between rooms
- **Agent behavior wizard step** (`AgentBehaviorStep.tsx`) — New step 3: seat assignment (dropdown grouped by room), allowed-rooms checkboxes, energy slider (0=calm, 1=restless) per agent
- **Wizard expanded** from 3 to 4 steps: Connect → Build → Configure Agents → Launch
- **Agent state extended** (`agentState.ts`) — Energy field (0–1 float) drives idle animation speed/magnitude via `computeIdlePose()`
- **LiveView enhanced** (`LiveView.tsx`) — Pathfinding-driven movement, energy-based idle animation, room access control
- **Config schema extended** (`config.ts`) — `seat`, `allowedRooms`, `energy` fields added to agent config
- Fixed `catalogItemToFurniture` rug rotation bug: `defaultRotation` now applied regardless of `glbPath`
- Deduplicated `AgentBehavior` interface: `LaunchStep.tsx` imports from `AgentBehaviorStep.tsx`
- Tests: 10 new pathfinding tests in `roomGraph.test.ts`, 6 new agent state tests. Total: 395+.

### 2026-04-09 — Agent Activity Visualization

Agents now show what they're doing, not just where they are. Activity is auto-derived from gateway events — no user mapping needed.

- **Activity state engine** (`activityState.ts`) — Pure-function module: 8 activity types (idle, talking, working, testing, presenting, listening, sending, reviewing). `deriveActivity(eventType, roomPreset)` pattern-matches event type first, falls back to room preset semantics. `formatEventLabel()` generates human-readable feed labels.
- **Activity indicators** (`ActivityIndicator3D.tsx`) — Html overlays above agent heads showing activity icon (speech bubble, microscope, satellite, etc.) with animated dots (talking/working) or CSS pulse (testing/sending), plus agent name label always visible.
- **Activity feed** (`ActivityFeed.tsx`) — Rolling log panel (bottom-left) showing last 15 events with agent color dots, readable labels, and relative timestamps. Auto-scrolls, updates every second.
- **LiveView wiring** — Activity derivation runs on every event regardless of pathfinding success. Activity timeout (8s) returns agents to idle. Random room fallback when event room names don't match config rooms (demo mode compatibility).
- **AgentFigure3D** extended with `activity` prop to render `ActivityIndicator3D`.
- Tests: 27 new activity state tests. Total: 422+.

### 2026-04-09 — Live View Fix (Camera + Auto-Seating)

Fixed the live view (post-wizard `/` page) which was completely broken — camera pointed at origin while rooms rendered elsewhere, agents spawned at wrong coordinates.

- **DioramaScene** (`DioramaScene.tsx`) — Added `center` prop and `CameraSync` component (same pattern as `BuildStep3D.tsx`). Camera dynamically positions at `[centerX, 20, centerZ + 15]` looking at room centroid. Falls back to default position when no center provided.
- **LiveView rewrite** (`LiveView.tsx`) — Calculates `roomsCenter` from config rooms using `toWorld()` (same as wizard). Passes center to DioramaScene. Agents auto-seat in chairs: builds seat pool from room furniture, assigns round-robin, places at chair world positions with `mode: "seated"`. Overflow agents stand near room center.
- **Stripped pathfinding from events** — Agents stay seated. Events trigger activity indicators + room glow + feed entries only. No walking/movement complexity.
- **Removed imports**: `buildRoomGraph`, `findRoomPath`, `generateWaypoints`, `findRoomContaining`, `updateAgentState`.
